# Optimization
Repository in which there are two examples of optimization problems solved in python with gurobi

One in based on the graph structure (network flow with demands, costs and comodities), and the other one has an easier structure which main purpose is 
finding the optimal value of the objective function (max/min z), subject to constraints.
