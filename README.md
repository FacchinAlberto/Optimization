# Optimization
Repository in which there are two examples of optimization problems solved in python with gurobi library.

"example2.py" is based on the graph structure (network flow with demands, costs and comodities), instead the other one ("example1.py") has an easier structure which main purpose is finding the optimal value of the objective function (max/min z), subject to constraints.
